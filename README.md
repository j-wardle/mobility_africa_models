# Gaps in mobility data and implications for modelling epidemic spread: A scoping review and simulation study

This repository contains code to reproduce figures and analysis from the paper found here: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epidem.2023.100666.

This is an [`orderly`](https://github.com/vimc/orderly) project.  The directories are:

* `src`: create new reports here
* `archive`: versioed results of running your report
* `data`: copies of data used in the reports

Tasks for processing data, fitting mobility models, running the commuter model, and summarising and visualizing results are found in the src directory of this repo.
